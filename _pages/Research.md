I completed my PhD in April 2020, under the supervision of Charlotte Deane and Gesine Reinert at the University of Oxford. [My thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c28f1db6-0ce8-4d36-8bea-2ed310cbdb25) explored the uncertainty associated with protein interaction data and its effects on network analysis.

## Uncertainty in protein-protein interaction networks

Protein-protein interaction data is obtained through a range of experimental techniques, each of which is subject to experimental error. When we build and analyse protein interaction networks using such data, we often ignore the uncertainty associated with it. It is therefore not always clear whether the conclusions we draw from such analysis are biologically relevant, or whether they are artifacts of the data. I am generally interested in studying the robustness of network analysis pipelines to data uncertainty.

## Robust construction of gene co-expression networks

Gene co-expression, or the highly correlated abundance of gene products in the cell, is indicative of shared genetic function. This is why we use gene co-expression networks in order to do predict gene function, or to identify genes of interest, e.g. in a disease. However, there is no single standard way of building such networks: data processing pipelines and in particular how co-expression values are calculated vary from study to study. I am interested in how we prioritise network construction methodologies, especially in cases where there is insufficient external validation data.
