I'm a bioinformatician with a keen interest in how experimental error and data uncertainty affect what we can and cannot infer from biological networks. I'm currently working as a postdoc in [Patrick Chinnery's lab](http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/people/patrick-chinnery) at the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit, University of Cambridge, where I study mtDNA heteroplasmy.

Before  my current role I was a departmental lecturer at the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford. There I studied publication bias in protein–protein interaction data and supervised MSc research projects. In the past I have also worked in the biotech industry. I completed my PhD in 2020 at the University of Oxford, where I was supervised by [Gesine Reinert](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~reinert/) and [Charlotte Deane](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deane/#). As a PhD student I was part of the [Systems Approaches to Biomedical Science CDT](https://www.sabsr3.ox.ac.uk/home) and worked in collaboration with [e-therapeutics plc](https://www.etherapeutics.co.uk/).

In addition to research, over the years I've been involved in a range of teaching and outreach efforts, as well as ED&I initiatives. Most recently I joined the MBU’s Wellbeing, Inclusion, Diversity and Equality (MBU WIDE) committee.
