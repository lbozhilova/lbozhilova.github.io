I'm a network scientist with a keen interest in bioinformatics and more specifically in how experimental error and data uncertainty affect what we can and cannot infer from biological networks. I'm currently working as a departmental lecturer at the Department of Statistics, University of Oxford.

Before my current role, I was a data science research associate at [Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/). Prior to that, I completed my PhD at the University of Oxford, where I was supervised by [Gesine Reinert](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~reinert/) and [Charlotte Deane](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deane/#). As a PhD student I was part of the [Systems Approaches to Biomedical Science CDT](https://www.sabsr3.ox.ac.uk/home) and worked in collaboration with [e-therapeutics plc](https://www.etherapeutics.co.uk/).

In addition to research, I'm heavily involved in teaching at Oxford, as well as in outreach activities such as the [Oxford Maths Festival](https://mathsfest.web.ox.ac.uk/home). As a member of the [Oxford Protein Informatics Group](http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/) I used to occasionally contribute to the group's blog, affectionately called BLOPIG. You can see my posts, which range from CS to outreach to pure silliness [here](https://www.blopig.com/blog/author/lyuba/).
