I am a bioinformatician with a keen interest in network analysis and more specifically in how experimental errors and data uncertainty affect what we can and cannot infer from biological networks.

I recently completed my PhD at the University of Oxford, where I was supervised by [Gesine Reinert](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~reinert/) and [Charlotte Deane](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~deane/#). As I PhD student I was part of the [Systems Approaches to Biomedical Science CDT](https://www.sabsr3.ox.ac.uk/home) and worked in collaboration with [e-therapeutics plc](https://www.etherapeutics.co.uk/). I am currently working as a bioinformatician at [Relation Therapeutics](https://www.relationrx.com/). 

In addition to research, I have been heavily involved in teaching at the University of Oxford, as well as in outreach activities such as the [Oxford Maths Festival](https://mathsfest.web.ox.ac.uk/home). As a member of the [Oxford Protein Informatics Group](http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/) I used to occasionally contribute to the group's blog, affectionately called BLOPIG. You can see my posts, which range from CS to outreach to pure silliness [here](https://www.blopig.com/blog/author/lyuba/).
