I am a data scientist with a keen interest in how experimental error and uncertainty affect what we can and cannot infer from biomedical data. I am currently working as a postdoc in [Oxford Labour Monitoring](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/research/oxfordlabourmonitoringgroup) in the Nuffield Department of Women's & Reproductive Health, University of Oxford. I study the clinical risk factors associated with fetal distress and brain injury during labour. 

Before my current role, I was in [Patrick Chinnery's lab](https://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/chinnery-group) at the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit, University of Cambridge, where I worked on mtDNA heteroplasmy. And before that, I spent a number of years in the Department of Statistics at Oxford, first as a student and later as a lecturer, mostly thinking about protein interaction networks. While I am now excited to be working with large-scale maternity healthcare data, I do retain a research interest in both mitochondrial genetics and biological networks.

In addition to research, over the years I have been involved in a range of teaching and outreach efforts, as well as ED&I initiatives. Do get in touch if you want to chat about any of these!

Finally, I spend far too much of my free time trail running, which I approach with the enthusiasm of a five year old: all a girl needs is some puddles to splash in, and an ice cream after.
