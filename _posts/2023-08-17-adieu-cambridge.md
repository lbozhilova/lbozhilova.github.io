Cambridge has treated me well these past two years. I have done some decent science (hopefully another paper coming out very soon!), and in the process I have learnt a bit about myself and about the kind of work I want to do going forward. I have met excellent people, who I am lucky to call friends and colleagues. I have done a frankly ridiculous amount of running. My time at [Newnham](https://newn.cam.ac.uk/) has been something special.

There are a couple more mitochondrial projects I am hoping to tie up in the coming months, but it is now time for new adventures and old friends. From September I will be joining [Oxford Labour Monitoring](https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/research/oxfordlabourmonitoringgroup) as a senior postdoc working on fetal risk assessment. I am very lucky and beyond excited!
