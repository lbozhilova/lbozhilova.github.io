# `ggplot2` tutorial

A while back I wrote a `ggplot2` data visualisation tutorial. This was part of an in-person workshop aimed at lab-based colleagues, but the materials are online and have received some positive feedback as a standalone resource! You can find the tutorial as presented to participants [here](https://lbozhilova.github.io/pfc-datavis-tutorial/) and the full GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/lbozhilova/pfc-datavis-tutorial).

I carried out this work in my capacity as a [Data Champion](https://www.data.cam.ac.uk/intro-data-champions) at the University of Cambridge. The data championship programme brings together data enthusiasts across the university, and has been a great way to meet like-minded people from different departments.
